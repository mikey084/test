# Skin Segmentation Project

The following project is a breakdown of the skin segmentation dataset. We have applied four models, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM to analyze the dataset. This is a classification based project and we are testing the effects of RGB color values in determining either skin or nonskin classification. RGB is integer value based measurement for color.

The following pynb file is our code analysis breakdown, and I have also attached the final report document as a pdf file.
